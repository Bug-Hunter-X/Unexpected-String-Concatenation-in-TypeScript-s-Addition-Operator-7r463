This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in TypeScript involving the `+` operator.  TypeScript's type system doesn't strictly enforce type safety in all cases, particularly when it comes to implicit type coercion.  The `bug.ts` file shows how adding numbers and strings with `+` results in string concatenation instead of a numerical addition. This can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to track down.  The solution file (`bugSolution.ts`) offers approaches to prevent this issue.
